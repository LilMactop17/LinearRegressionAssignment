We chose to create a balanced and un-balanced output for the Linear Regression Model.

We multiplied the importance of experimental SOH values below 0.75 by 4 to make more accurate predictions in critical
and near critical State of Health regions, while keeping the balanced model to show improvements and deteriorations
between both regression weightings. Reviewing the dataset showed a minimal amount of SOH values below 0.75 (shown by the
Count being 20/134), leading us to prioritize those few values as Linear Regression finds coefficients for each X value
that bring each point as close as possible to the target graph, in this case a Linear graph (ie. X=Y, or 45 degrees).
Given that most values are in very safe regions, the model would naturally have more data in those regions to get an
accurate measurement, but the goal is to accurately predict low SOH batteries, which led to the implementation of data
balancing.

Given the Global results for both the Balanced and Unbalanced models, we found some deteriorations in accuracy, as the
Mean Squared Error increased, in addition to a decrease in R^2, which represents less accuracy in the model overall.
However, when evaluating near critical SOH values, there was a 41% improvement in the Mean Squared Error, and a ~2.1
increase in the low r^2 values, indicating a significant improvement in lower SOH regions. We also incorporated absolute
errors to test how accurate each prediction is. We implemented the 95th percentile of low SOH values, and the +- range
of predicted SOH values dropped from ~0.108 to ~0.087, meaning 95% of all low SOH values fell in a closer range to the
expected graph.
